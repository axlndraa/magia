# Magia

Magia is an automated processing pipeline for brain PET studies. Magia uses FreeSurfer to parcellate the brain into anatomical regions of interest, and performs kinetic modeling using tools developed over the years at Turku PET Center.

Magia has been shown to generate reference regions that yield results similar to results derived using manually delineated reference regions (Karjalainen et al. 2019, https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2020.00003). Please cite the paper if you use Magia.

Please see the wiki page (https://github.com/tkkarjal/magia/wiki) for installation and usage instructions.
